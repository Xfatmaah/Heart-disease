# Heart-disease-prediction

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
1. Random Forest 
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer

Accuracy achieved:
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/data

## Dataset Information:
The dataset consists of 319795 rows and 18 columns with label Target. Data contains categorical as well as continuous data.

## Data Cleansing:
There were some duplicated rows that can easily be dropped & no any null-values.

## Data Visualization:
* I plot graph of label (Target) to show the ratio of heart Disease.
* Count of Heartdisease with different features
* Box plot to detect if there are any outliers
  " Percentage of outliers is large so we can not drop them,in case of having an imbalanced data, it's recommended to keep the outliers."
* Correlation matrix to find most dependent variable to the label
